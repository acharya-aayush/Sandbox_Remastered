# Ultimate Sandbox Remastered with Kingdom of Nepal

This comprehensive Unciv mod combines powerful sandbox gameplay elements with an authentic representation of the Kingdom of Nepal as a fully playable civilization.

## The Kingdom of Nepal Civilization

The mod introduces the Kingdom of Nepal as a major addition, featuring historically accurate content that goes beyond typical mountain stereotypes. This civilization represents all three geographic regions of Nepal - the Terai plains, Pahad hills, and Himal mountains - while honoring the country's unique "Never Conquered" heritage and Hindu-majority secular culture.

Players can experience Nepal's rich military tradition through twelve unique Gurkha units spanning from ancient times to the modern era, alongside twelve distinctive buildings that represent iconic locations from Singha Durbar to the remote Mustang trade routes.

## Unique Buildings

The Kingdom of Nepal features twelve distinctive buildings that showcase the country's diverse geography and rich cultural heritage. These structures are divided into national wonders and regional buildings that reflect authentic Nepali landmarks.

The national wonders include Singha Durbar, the grand government palace restricted to the capital city, and Lumbini, the sacred Buddhist pilgrimage site marking Buddha's birthplace. Chitwan National Park represents Nepal's commitment to wildlife conservation, while Janakpur Dham honors the country's Hindu heritage with its magnificent temple complex.

Regional buildings span all three geographic zones, from the Terai Rice Terraces that enhance agricultural production in the southern plains, to the Himalayan Monastery providing spiritual guidance in the high mountains. The Bagmati Riverfront facilitates river commerce, while Everest Base Camp and Pokhara Lake Resort capitalize on Nepal's world-renowned mountain tourism. Cultural sites like Kathmandu Durbar Square preserve traditional heritage, and structures like the Annapurna Trail Lodge and Mustang Trade Route reflect Nepal's role as a crossroads for high-altitude trade and trekking.

## Military Forces

The Kingdom of Nepal boasts a complete military roster that honors the legendary Gurkha warrior tradition throughout history. These twelve unique units progress from ancient warriors wielding the iconic curved khukuri blade to modern special forces equipped with contemporary military technology.

Early units include the Khukuri Warrior, representing Nepal's ancient martial traditions, and the Sherpa Guide, whose unmatched knowledge of mountain terrain makes them invaluable for reconnaissance. Medieval forces feature the Mountain Archer and Himalayan Ranger, both specialized for combat in Nepal's challenging terrain.

As gunpowder technology arrives, the Gurkha Rifleman emerges, followed by the classic Gurkha soldier that made Nepal's military reputation worldwide. The Royal Nepal Army represents the kingdom's professional military forces, while the Gurkha Sniper demonstrates the precision and skill that made Nepali marksmen famous across the globe.

Modern era forces include the battle-hardened Gurkha Veteran, the elite Gurkha Commando capable of airborne operations, and the mechanized Gurkha Khukuri Corps that combines traditional warrior spirit with contemporary military technology. The civilization also features the Yak Caravan, a unique civilian unit that facilitates trade across high-altitude mountain passes where other traders cannot venture.

## Additional Sandbox Features

Beyond the Kingdom of Nepal, this mod retains the original sandbox elements that make it valuable for testing and creative gameplay. These include overpowered sandbox units designed for experimentation, resource manipulation capabilities for mod developers, and creative mode functionality that allows unrestricted gameplay exploration.

## Kingdom of Nepal Civilization Details

The civilization is led by Prithvi Narayan Shah, the visionary king who unified the various kingdoms and principalities into modern Nepal. The unique national ability "Never Conquered" reflects Nepal's remarkable history as the only South Asian nation to maintain independence throughout the colonial period, providing combat bonuses when fighting larger civilizations and enhanced defensive capabilities within the kingdom's own territory.

The civilization has a natural affinity for hills and mountains, reflecting Nepal's dramatic topography, and includes historically significant cities such as Kathmandu, Pokhara, Chitwan, Lumbini, and Janakpur among others.
